# Jesse Hoffman - Personal Website ðŸš€

This website shows some of things things I've been working on lately. It also serves as a place for me to expirement with different tools and techiques in this wild web world.

## What's in the Box

- [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli)
- [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)
- [Modular Scale](https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-js)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

I'm a big fan of the idea of minimalism in the development, so I tend to favor ultra-lightweight libs.

Test commit.
